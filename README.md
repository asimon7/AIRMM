Project fot the Interest Rate Models and Markets course at Unibo 2021/22


For the final grade me and two colleagues had to solve three problems presented below:

1. Cap/Floor pricing: using the relevant yield curves and Cap/Floor market volatilities provided in the market data sheets, compute all the possible prices for Caps and Floors.

2. Cap/Floor volatility: using the Caps/Floors market prices provided in the market data sheets, build the corresponding shifted-lognormal Black implied term volatility surface, for different values of the shifts.

3. Cap/Floor risk: derive analytically the formulas for shifted-lognormal Black delta and vega sensitivities for Caplets/Floorlets and Caps/Floors. Compute and plot deltas and term vega for market Caps/Floors using both analytical formulas and numerical finite difference method and compare the results (total 3x2x2 greeks). Check the dependence on the numerical shifts used for finite differences.
